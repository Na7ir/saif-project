<h1>WELCOME TO <span>CITY COLLEGE</span></h1><br><br>
<p class="para">Established in Karachi in 1978, The City college today one of the largest private college networks across the globe. Having more than   500 schools with over 150,000 students, we continue tobe    expand our reach in other countries including United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Philippines,  Oman, and Saudi Arabia, to meet the demands for quality education as well as to ensure a strong  global presence
</p><br>
<p class="push">The vision that is the bedrock of The City college Group stems from our belief in the power of education to transform lives, attitudes, and prospects. Our determination to be a positive influence for change, and to increase access to quality education across the country, initiated the incentive to launch The city college Network in 2012 â€“ a franchise model that is now firmly established and flourishing. With more than 400 campuses and 100,000 students, The city college takes students all the way from Playgroup to Class X11.</p>
